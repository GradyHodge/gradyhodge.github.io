        <h2>McKinney, TX - I've lived here my whole life</h2>
        <p>
            I'm on a 7 year old 64 bit HP Windows 10 PC. <br>
            I'm in line to inherit my boss's suped up 27" Mac because he needs to edit 4K video. <br>
            I'm grateful for such a gift but I'm secretly trepidatious about switching to a Mac. <br>
            I believe Apple died with Steve Jobs and there are a lot of lousy business practices Apple employs for servicing old computers. <br>
            Also, since Microsoft rolled out VS Code and bought up GitHub and is actually improving it I have high hopes to stick with the MS OS.
        </p>
        <p>My computer currently has 4 GB of RAM installed, but 3.75 is usable. </p>
        <p>My processor is an AMD Athlon II X4 630, 2.8 GHz<br>
        Nothing fancy but it works well enough
