This week I had fun taking my time and becoming very familiar with the HTML tags. Since I’ve been exposed to the basics of HTML I dived a little deeper to learn what some of the meta tags were for.
My peers comments were very supportive and helpful. The most helpful thing about our discussion board were the nice comments from my peers. It was a great confidence builder.  I’ve been very shy about diving in to coding. I’m surprised how much I’ve been picking up through self study. My peers comments helped me recognize I have learned a lot in a short amount of time.
This week while reviewing my peers code I became familiar with the basics patterns.  I wish I could view them all in an editor where they are properly tabbed, or whatever you called it when you indent to match the closing tab. 
I couldn’t figure out how to display my code visually. I’m such a novice the simple things allude me. The most basic parts of coding can trip me up for hours.
