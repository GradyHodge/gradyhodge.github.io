<!--
    Did you know the Odometer was invented by a Mormon Pioneer 
    who was tasked by Brigham Young with counting how many times a rag 
    tied to the spoke of a wheel made a full rotation so they could estimate their travel distance?

            Converting Mileage
        </title>
        <!--
            Write a defining table and a JavaScript program to compute the mileage of a vehicle. 
            Your program should allow the user to enter the beginning and ending odometer readings and the number of gallons of gasoline used 
            and should output the mileage in miles per gallon. Your program should correctly handle real numbers.
        
            Defining Table
             Input: 3 variables- beginning and ending mileage, and gallons of gas spent
           Process: subtract ending mileag from beginning mileage and then divide by gallons used
            Output: display the mpg in real numbers
